# CodeClauseInternship
Python

During my data science internship, I delved into diverse datasets, employing Python and advanced statistical methods to extract actionable insights. From exploratory data analysis to machine learning model development, I contributed to real-world projects, refining my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling. I tackled challenges head-on, honing my ability to communicate complex findings effectively. 

**Employee Attrition**- 
I conducted comprehensive analyses on factors influencing workforce turnover within an organization. Employing machine learning algorithms, I developed predictive models to identify key indicators of attrition risk, such as job satisfaction, tenure, and performance metrics. Through data visualization techniques, I visualized trends and patterns, aiding in the formulation of strategic retention strategies.

**Iris dataset**- 
A classic benchmark in machine learning. Utilizing Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn, I performed exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the dataset's floral species. Employing various classification algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors, I developed models to accurately classify iris flowers based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

**Parkinson's disease analysis**- Utilizing datasets comprising clinical parameters and biomarkers. Employing Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn, I conducted exploratory data analysis to uncover correlations and trends within patient data. Utilizing machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and random forest, I built predictive models to classify patients based on disease progression and severity.
